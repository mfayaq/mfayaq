- 👋 Hi, I’m @mfayaq
- 👀 I’m interested in working on new technologies. Primarily using MERN as my stack.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning WebSockets, increasing my focus toward backend development. 
     I have a better grasp of the frontend(React). But looking to improve on the backend and learning underlying protocols.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on amazing projects, solving real world problems. 
     Technology is not a constraint, I always look forward to learn more.
